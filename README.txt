Chat Room allows users to talk together in real time. Users enter chat rooms
which can have multiple chats. Permissions can be set to restrict who can
access, edit, and create chats and chat rooms.

You can:

Create a chat room (at node/add/chatroom).
View a list of chat rooms (at chatrooms).
Add a title to the list of chat rooms (at admin/settings/chatroom).
Archive chats on the chat room edit page.
