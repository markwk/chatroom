   modules folder.

HACKING
=======

Chatroom is currently under heavy development. The DRUPAL-6--2 branch is where
the action is, while the DRUPAL-6--1 branch is strictly for bug fixes, and will
be deprecated as soon as the DRUPAL-6--2 branch is stable enough.

Check the HACKING.txt file and the issues queue for the latest.

Patches, testers, feature suggestions, bug reports etc all welcome!
